# DontGetKicked_Kaggle_Competition



## Problem Statement

To predict if the car purchased at the Auction is a Kick (bad buy)


## Background

An auto dealership faces a significant challenge when purchasing used cars at auctions due to the potential risk of acquiring vehicles with serious issues that make them unsuitable for sale. These problematic purchases are commonly referred to as "kicks" within the auto community.

Kicked cars often arise from various factors such as tampered odometers, unresolved mechanical problems, difficulties in obtaining the vehicle title from the seller, or other unexpected issues. Dealing with kick cars can be financially burdensome for dealerships, involving expenses for transportation, extensive repairs, and losses when trying to resell the vehicle.
