# DontGetKicked_Kaggle_Competition



## Problem Statement

To predict if the car purchased at the Auction is a Kick (bad buy)


## Background

An auto dealership faces a significant challenge when purchasing used cars at auctions due to the potential risk of acquiring vehicles with serious issues that make them unsuitable for sale. These problematic purchases are commonly referred to as "kicks" within the auto community.

Kicked cars often arise from various factors such as tampered odometers, unresolved mechanical problems, difficulties in obtaining the vehicle title from the seller, or other unexpected issues. Dealing with kick cars can be financially burdensome for dealerships, involving expenses for transportation, extensive repairs, and losses when trying to resell the vehicle.

## Data Overview

There are 34 Feature
The data conatins missing values
The target feature has 2 catagories hence its a binary classification problem
More context on data is in Carvana_Data_Dictionary.txt

## Approach
 **On understanding it is a binary classification problem the below tasks were performed.**
### Task Performed
1. Data Ingestion
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Transformation and Feature engineering
 4. Data Split
5. Model Training
6. Model Testing
7. Model Evaluation

#### Data Ingestion

Basics imports of module and Data from train and test CSV files. Understanding and Descriptive statics of Train and Test Data.



#### 1) Exploratory Data Analysis
